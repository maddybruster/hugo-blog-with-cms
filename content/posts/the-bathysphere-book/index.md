A wide ranging, philosophical, and sensual account of early deep sea exploration and its afterlives, *The Bathysphere Book* begins with the first ever voyage to the deep ocean in 1930 and expands to explore the adventures and entanglements of its all-too-human participants at a time when the world still felt entirely new. Astra House, 2023.
